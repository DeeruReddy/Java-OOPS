# Java OOPs and Search Algorithms

This repository contains simple, well-documented Java programs that demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts as well as classic search algorithms such as **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**.

## 📁 Contents

- `Main.java` — Entry point of the program demonstrating OOP implementation.
- `Linear.java` — Java implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- `Binary.java` — Java implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.
- `oops_concept.txt` — Notes and snippets explaining the OOP structure in the project.
- `Formula.txt` — Explanation of Binary and Linear Search with formulas and small examples.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🏛 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance (Super & Subclass)
- Constructors
- Method Overriding (`@Override`)
- Keywords: `this`, `super`

### 🔍 Search Algorithms

#### Binary Search
- Works on sorted arrays
- Efficient for large datasets
- Midpoint calculation techniques for small and large data

#### Linear Search
- Works on unsorted arrays
- Simpler but slower for large datasets
