# Java OOPs, Search, and Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains beginner-friendly, well-documented Java programs that demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, classic **search algorithms** like Linear and Binary Search, and now includes **Bubble Sort** implementations under sorting fundamentals.

## 📁 Contents

- `Main.java` — Entry point of the program demonstrating OOP implementation.
- `Linear.java` — Java implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- `Binary.java` — Java implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.
- `BubleSort.java` — Basic Bubble Sort implementation using nested loops.
- `BubleSortEx1.java` — Optimized Bubble Sort with reduced iterations.
- `oops_concept.txt` — Notes and snippets explaining OOP structure and ideas.
- `Formula.txt` — Explanation of Binary and Linear Search with formulas and examples.
- `sorting.txt` — Handwritten notes covering Bubble and Selection Sort step-by-step with logic breakdown.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🏛 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance (Super & Subclass)
- Constructors
- Method Overriding (`@Override`)
- Keywords: `this`, `super`

### 🔍 Search Algorithms

#### Binary Search
- Operates on sorted arrays
- Faster for large datasets (O(log n))
- Includes midpoint optimization logic

#### Linear Search
- Works on unsorted arrays
- Simple and sequential (O(n))

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
- Swaps adjacent elements repeatedly until sorted
- Demonstrates nested loop logic and element swapping
- Includes both basic and optimized implementations

#### Selection Sort *(theory notes only for now)*
- Selects the minimum element and places it in correct position
