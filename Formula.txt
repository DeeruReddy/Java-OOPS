Binary Search:

	- Sorted Array
	- Finding the mid value
	- Large Dataset


Int a[] = {10,20, 30, 40, 50}
		
	int lb = 0;	
	int up = a.length-1;
	
	mid = (lb+up)/2  --> for smaller datasets

	mid = lb + (up-lb)/2 --> for large datasets


Linear Search:
	- Unsorted array
	- No need to find the mid value
	- Small Dataset

Int a[] = {40, 10, 20, 18, 50}
